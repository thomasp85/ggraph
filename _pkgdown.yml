  - title: "Plot Construction"
    desc: >
      While ggraph builds on top of ggplot2 it uses its own function to
      initialise plots, allowing you to set global settings such as layouts etc.
    contents:
      - ggraph
      - autograph
  - title: "Layouts"
    desc: >
      Layouts specify the spatial positioning of the nodes in the graph. In
      addition to calculating x and y coordinates for the nodes some layouts
      also calculate additional metrics used when plotting, e.g. width and
      height for treemap layouts. Layouts are specified in the `ggraph()` call
      or precalculated using `create_layout()`.
    contents:
      - layout_tbl_graph_auto
      - layout_tbl_graph_manual
      - layout_tbl_graph_stress
      - layout_tbl_graph_igraph

  - title: "Nodes"
    desc: >
      While nodes are often thought of as points in a hairball graph, they are
      much more than that, depending on the layout type.
    contents:
      - geom_node_point
      - geom_node_text
      - geom_node_tile
      - geom_node_voronoi
      - geom_node_circle
      - geom_node_arc_bar
      - geom_node_range
  - title: "Edges"
    desc: >
      Edges are the entities connecting nodes, often drawn with some sort of
      line. Certain layouts calls for other types, e.g. a matrix plot where
      edges are illustrated with points.
    contents:
      - geom_edge_link
      - geom_edge_arc
      - geom_edge_parallel
      - geom_edge_fan
      - geom_edge_loop
      - geom_edge_diagonal
      - geom_edge_elbow
      - geom_edge_bend
      - geom_edge_hive
      - geom_edge_span
      - geom_edge_point
      - geom_edge_tile
      - geom_edge_density
      - geom_edge_bundle_force
      - geom_edge_bundle_path
      - geom_edge_bundle_minimal
  - title: "Connections"
    desc: >
      Connections are meta-edges, connecting nodes that are not direct
      neighbors, either through their shortest path or directly.
    contents:
      - geom_conn_bundle
  - title: "Facets"
    desc: >
      Faceting with networks is a bit different than for tabular data, as you'd
      often want to facet only nodes, or edges etc.
    contents:
      - facet_graph
      - facet_nodes
      - facet_edges
  - title: "Scales"
    desc: >
      While nodes uses the standard scales provided by ggplot2, edges have their
      own, allowing you to have different scaling for nodes and edges.
    contents:
      - scale_edge_colour
      - scale_edge_fill
      - scale_edge_alpha
      - scale_edge_width
      - scale_edge_size
      - scale_edge_linetype
      - scale_edge_shape
      - scale_label_size
  - title: "Guides"
    desc: >
      As for scales, the edge geoms comes with their own guides.
    contents:
      - guide_edge_direction
      - guide_edge_colourbar
      - guide_edge_coloursteps
  - title: "Helpers"
    desc: >
      ggraph contains an assortment of helpers for various tasks related to
      plotting.
    contents:
      - geom_axis_hive
      - get_nodes
      - get_edges
      - get_con
      - geometry
      - node_angle
      - pack_circles
      - theme_graph
  - title: "Data"
    desc: >
      To facilitate playing around ggraph includes a set of small network
      datasets
    contents:
      - flare
      - highschool
      - whigs
