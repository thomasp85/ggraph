\title{Create heirarchical edge bundles between node connections}
\usage{
geom_conn_bundle(mapping = NULL, data = gCon(), position = "identity",
  arrow = NULL, lineend = "butt", show.legend = NA, n = 100,
  tension = 0.8, ...)

geom_conn_bundle2(mapping = NULL, data = gCon(), position = "identity",
  arrow = NULL, lineend = "butt", show.legend = NA, n = 100,
  tension = 0.8, ...)

geom_conn_bundle0(mapping = NULL, data = gCon(), position = "identity",
  arrow = NULL, lineend = "butt", show.legend = NA, tension = 0.8, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}}
or \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes_}}. By default x, y, xend, yend, group and
circular are mapped to x, y, xend, yend, edge.id and circular in the edge
data.}

\item{data}{The result of a call to \code{\link{gCon}}}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{arrow}{Arrow specification, as created by \code{\link[grid]{arrow}}}

\item{lineend}{Line end style (round, butt, square)}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{n}{The number of points to create along the path.}

\item{tension}{How "loose" should the bundles be. 1 will give very tight
bundles, while 0 will turn of bundling completely and give straight lines.
Defaults to 0.8}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link{layer}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\description{
Hierarchical edge bundling is a technique to introduce some order into the
hairball structure that can appear when there's a lot of overplotting and
edge crossing in a network plot. The concept requires that the network has
an intrinsic hierarchical structure that defines the layout but is not shown.
Connections between points (that is, not edges) are then drawn so that they
loosely follows the underlying hierarchical structure. This results in a
flow-like structure where lines that partly move in the same direction will
be bundled togeether.
}
\note{
In order to avoid excessive typing edge aesthetic names are
automatically expanded. Because of this it is not necessary to write
\code{edge_colour} within the \code{aes()} call as \code{colour} will
automatically be renamed appropriately.
}
\section{Aesthetics}{

geom_conn_bundle* understands the following aesthetics. Bold aesthetics are
automatically set, but can be overridden.
\itemize{
 \item{\strong{x}}
 \item{\strong{y}}
 \item{\strong{group}}
 \item{\strong{circular}}
 \item{edge_colour}
 \item{edge_width}
 \item{edge_linetype}
 \item{edge_alpha}
 \item{filter}
}
}

\section{Computed variables}{


\describe{
 \item{index}{The position along the path (not computed for the *0 version)}
}
}

# Create a graph of the flare class system
