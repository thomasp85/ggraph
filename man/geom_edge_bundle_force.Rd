\usage{
geom_edge_bundle_force(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = get_edges(),
  position = "identity",
  arrow = NULL,
  lineend = "butt",
  show.legend = NA,
  K = 1,
  C = 6,
  P = 1,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{ggplot2::aes()}}
or \code{\link[ggplot2:aes_]{ggplot2::aes_()}}. By default x, y, xend, yend, group and
circular are mapped to x, y, xend, yend, edge.id and circular in the edge
data.}

\item{data}{The return of a call to \code{get_edges()} or a data.frame
giving edges in correct format (see details for for guidance on the format).
See \code{\link[=get_edges]{get_edges()}} for more details on edge extraction.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string naming the adjustment
(e.g. \code{"jitter"} to use \code{position_jitter}), or the result of a call to a
position adjustment function. Use the latter if you need to change the
settings of the adjustment.}

\item{arrow}{Arrow specification, as created by \code{\link[grid:arrow]{grid::arrow()}}.}

\item{lineend}{Line end style (round, butt, square).}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{K}{spring force}

\item{C}{number of iteration cycles}

\item{P}{initial number of edge divisions}

\item{S}{initial step size}

\item{P_rate}{factor for how many new division points to add after a cycle}

\item{I}{number of iteration steps per cycle}

\item{I_rate}{factor of how to decrease the number of iterations per cycle}

\item{compatibility_threshold}{threshold for considering two edges to be interacting}

\item{eps}{tolerance}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{colour = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}
}
\description{
This geom performs force directed edge bundling to reduce visual clutter.
It uses a self-organizing approach to bundling in which edges are modeled as flexible springs
that can attract each other without the need of a hierarchy.
}
\section{Edge aesthetic name expansion}{

In order to avoid excessive typing edge aesthetic names are
automatically expanded. Because of this it is not necessary to write
\code{edge_colour} within the \code{aes()} call as \code{colour} will
automatically be renamed appropriately.
}

\section{Aesthetics}{

\code{geom_edge_bundle_force} understand the following
aesthetics. Bold aesthetics are automatically set, but can be overridden.
\itemize{
\item \strong{x}
\item \strong{y}
\item \strong{xend}
\item \strong{yend}
\item edge_colour
\item edge_width
\item edge_linetype
\item edge_alpha
\item filter
}
}

\section{Computed variables}{


\describe{
\item{index}{The position along the path (not computed for the *0 version)}
}
