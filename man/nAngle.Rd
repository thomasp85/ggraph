\title{Get the angle of nodes and edges}
\usage{
nAngle(x, y, degrees = TRUE)

eAngle(x, y, xend, yend, degrees = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{A vector of positions}

\item{degrees}{Logical. Should the angle be returned in degree (\code{TRUE})
or radians (\code{FALSE}). Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{xend, yend}{The end position of the edge}
}
\value{
A vector with the angle of each node/edge
}
\description{
These helper functions makes it easy to calculate the angle associated with
nodes and edges. For nodes the angle is defined as the angle of the vector
pointing towards the node position, and is thus mainly suited for circular
layouts where it can be used to calculate the angle of labels. For edges it
is simply the angle of the vector describing the edge.
