\usage{
geom_edge_loop(mapping = NULL, data = gEdges(), position = "identity",
  arrow = NULL, lineend = "butt", show.legend = NA, n = 100, ...)

geom_edge_loop0(mapping = NULL, data = gEdges(), position = "identity",
  arrow = NULL, lineend = "butt", show.legend = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}}
or \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes_}}. By default x, y, xend, yend, group and
circular are mapped to x, y, xend, yend, edge.id and circular in the edge
data.}

\item{data}{The return of a call to \code{gEdges()} or a data.frame
giving edges in corrent format (see details for for guidance on the format).
See \code{\link{gEdges}} for more details on edge extraction.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{arrow}{Arrow specification, as created by \code{\link[grid]{arrow}}}

\item{lineend}{Line end style (round, butt, square)}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{n}{The number of points to create along the path.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link{layer}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}
}
\description{
This geom draws edge loops (edges starting and ending at the same node).
Loops are drawn as bezier curves starting and ending at the position of the
node and with control points protruding at an angle and in a direction
specified in the call. As the start and end node is always the same no *2
method is provided. Loops can severely clutter up your visualization which is
why they are decoupled from the other edge drawings. Only plot them if they
are of importance. If the graph doesn't contain any loops the geom adds
nothing silently.
}
\details{
Many geom_edge_* layers comes in 3 flavors depending on the level of control
needed over the drawing. The default (no numeric postfix) generate a number
of points (\code{n}) along the edge and draws it as a path. Each point along
the line has a numeric value associated with it giving the position along the
path, and it is therefore possible to show the direction of the edge by
mapping to this e.g. \code{colour = ..index..}. The version postfixed with a
"2" uses the "long" edge format (see \code{\link{gEdges}}) and makes it
possible to interpolate node parameter between the start and end node along
the edge. It is considerable less performant so should only be used if this
is needed. The version postfixed with a "0" draws the edge in the most
performant way, often directly using an appropriate grob from the grid
package, but does not allow for gradients along the edge.
}
\note{
In order to avoid excessive typing edge aesthetic names are
automatically expanded. Because of this it is not necessary to write
\code{edge_colour} within the \code{aes()} call as \code{colour} will
automatically be renamed appropriately.

\section{Aesthetics}{

geom_edge_diagonal and geom_edge_diagonal0 understand the following
aesthetics. Bold aesthetics are automatically set, but can be overridden.
\itemize{
 \item{\strong{x}}
 \item{\strong{y}}
 \item{\strong{from}}
 \item{\strong{to}}
 \item{\strong{angle} \emph{90}}
 \item{\strong{direction} \emph{45}}
 \item{\strong{strength} \emph{1}}
 \item{edge_colour}
 \item{edge_width}
 \item{edge_linetype}
 \item{edge_alpha}
 \item{filter}
}
}

\section{Computed variables}{


\describe{
 \item{index}{The position along the path (not computed for the *0 version)}
