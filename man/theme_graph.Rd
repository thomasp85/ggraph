\arguments{
\item{base_size, size, text_size, title_size, subtitle_size, strip_text_size, caption_size}{The size to use for the various text elements. \code{text_size} will be used as geom defaults}

\item{background}{The colour to use for the background. This theme sets all
background elements except for plot.background to \code{element_blank} so
this controls the background for all elements of the plot. Set to \code{NA}
to remove the background (thus making the plot transparent)}

\item{foreground}{The colour of foreground elements, specifically strip and
border. Set to \code{NA} to remove.}

\item{border}{Logical. Should border be drawn if a foreground colour is
provided?}

\item{text_colour, bg_text_colour, fg_text_colour, title_colour, subtitle_colour, strip_text_colour, caption_colour}{The colour of the text in the various text elements}

\item{title_margin, subtitle_margin, caption_margin}{The margin to use between the text elements and the plot area}

\item{plot_margin}{The plot margin}

\item{family, base_family, title_family, subtitle_family, strip_text_family, caption_family}{The font to use for the different elements}

\item{face, title_face, subtitle_face, strip_text_face, caption_face}{The fontface to use for the various text elements}

\item{...}{Parameters passed on the \code{theme_graph}}
}
\description{
When plotting graphs, networks, and trees the coordinate values are often of
no importance and axes are thus a distraction. \code{ggraph} comes with a
build-in theme that removes redundant elements in order to put focus on the
data. Furthermore the default behaviour is to use a narrow font so text takes
up less space. Theme colour is defined by a background and foreground colour
where the background defines the colour of the whole graphics area and the
foreground defines the colour of the strip and border. By default strip and
border is turned off as it is an unnecessary element unless facetting is
used. To add a foreground colour to a plot that is already using
\code{theme_graph} the \code{th_foreground} helper is provided. In order to
use this appearance as default use the \code{set_graph_style} function. An
added benefit of this is that it also changes the default text-related values
in the different geoms for a completely coherent look.
\code{unset_graph_style} can be used to revert the defaults back to their
default settings (that is, they are not necessarily reverted back to what
they were prior to calling \code{set_graph_style}).
