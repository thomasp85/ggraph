#' Calculate nodes as rectangels subdividing that of their parent
#'
#' A treemap is a space filling hierarchical layout that maps nodes to
#' rectangles. The rectangles of the children of a node is packed into the
#' rectangle of the node so that the size of a rectangle is a function of the
#' size of the children. The size of the leaf nodes can be mapped arbitrarily
#' (defaults to 1). Many different algorithms exists for dividing a rectangle
#' into smaller bits, some optimizing the aspect ratio and some focusing on the
#' ordering of the rectangles. See details for more discussions on this. The
#' treemap layout was first developed by Ben Shneiderman for visualizing disk
#' usage in the early '90 and has seen many improvements since.
#'
#' @details
#' Different approaches to dividing the rectangles in a treemap exists; all with
#' their strengths and weaknesses. Currently only the split algorithm is
#' implemented which strikes a good balance between aspect ratio and order
#' preservation, but other, more well-known, algorithms such as squarify and
#' slice-and-dice will eventually be implemented.

#'
#' *Split* (default)
#'
#' The Split algorithm was developed by Bjorn Engdahl in order to address the
#' downsides of both the original slice-and-dice algorithm (poor aspect ratio)
#' and the popular squarify algorithm (no ordering of nodes). It works by
#' finding the best cut in the ordered list of children in terms of making sure
#' that the two rectangles associated with the split will have optimal aspect
#' ratio.

#' @note
#' Treemap is a layout intended for trees, that is, graphs where nodes
#' only have one parent and zero or more children. If the provided graph does
#' not fit this format an attempt to convert it to such a format will be made.
#'
#' @param graph An `tbl_graph` object
#'
#' @param algorithm The name of the tiling algorithm to use. Defaults to 'split'
#'
#' @param weight An optional node variable to use as weight. Will only affect
#' the weight of leaf nodes as the weight of non-leaf nodes are derived from
#' their children.
#'
#' @param circular Logical. Should the layout be transformed to a circular
#' representation. Ignored.
#'
#' @param sort.by The name of a node variables to sort the nodes by.
#'
#' @param direction The direction of the tree in the graph. `'out'` (default)
#' means that parents point towards their children, while `'in'` means that
#' children point towards their parent.
#'
#' @param height The height of the bounding rectangle
#'
#' @param width The width of the bounding rectangle
#'
#' @return A data.frame with the columns `x`, `y`, `width`,
#' `height`, `leaf`, `depth`, `circular` as well as any
#' information stored as node variables in the tbl_graph object.
