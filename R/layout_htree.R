#' Layout binary trees in a fractal H formation
#'
#' This is a spac efficient layout only useful for binary trees. It is fractal
#' and works by offsetting child nodes from their parent either horizontally or
#' vertically depending on depth. The offset is decreased at each step by a
#' factor of the square root of 2.
#'
#' @note
#' H Tree is a layout intended for trees, that is, graphs where nodes
#' only have one parent and zero or more children. If the provided graph does
#' not fit this format an attempt to convert it to such a format will be made.
#'
#' @param graph An `tbl_graph` object
#'
#' @param sort.by The name of a node variable to sort the nodes by.
#'
#' @param direction The direction of the tree in the graph. `'out'` (default)
#' means that parents point towards their children, while `'in'` means that
#' children point towards their parent.
#'
#' @param circular Logical. Should the layout be transformed to a circular
#' representation. Ignored
#'
#' @return A data.frame with the columns `x`, `y`, `leaf`, `depth`, `circular`
#' as well as any information stored as node variables in the tbl_graph object.
