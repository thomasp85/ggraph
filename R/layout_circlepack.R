#' Calculate nodes as circles packed within their parent circle
#'
#' The circle packing algorithm is basically a treemap using circles instead of
#' rectangles. Due to the nature of circles they cannot be packed as efficeintly
#' leading to increased amount of "empty space" as compared to a treemap. This
#' can be beneficial though, as the added empty space can aid in visually
#' showing the hierarchy.
#'
#' @details
#' The circle packing is based on the algorithm developed by Weixin Wang and
#' collaborators which tries to find the most dense packing of circles as they
#' are added, one by one. This makes the algorithm very dependent on the order
#' in which circles are added and it is possible that layouts could sometimes
#' be optimized by choosing a different ordering. The algorithm for finding the
#' enclosing circle is the randomized incremental algorithm proposed by Emo
#' Welzl. Both of the above algorithms are the same as used in the D3.js
#' implementation of circle packing and their C++ implementation in ggraph is
#' inspired by Mike Bostocks JavaScript implementation.
#'
#' @note
#' Circle packing is a layout intended for trees, that is, graphs where nodes
#' only have one parent and zero or more children. If the provided graph does
#' not fit this format an attempt to convert it to such a format will be made.
#'
#' @param graph An `tbl_graph` object
#'
#' @param weight An optional node variable to use as weight. Will only affect
#' the weight of leaf nodes as the weight of non-leaf nodes are derived from
#' their children.
#'
#' @param circular Logical. Should the layout be transformed to a circular
#' representation. Ignored.
#'
#' @param sort.by The name of a node variable to sort the nodes by.
#'
#' @param direction The direction of the tree in the graph. `'out'` (default)
#' means that parents point towards their children, while `'in'` means that
#' children point towards their parent.
#'
#' @return A data.frame with the columns `x`, `y`, `r`, `leaf`,
#' `depth`, `circular` as well as any information stored as node
#' variables in the tbl_graph object.
